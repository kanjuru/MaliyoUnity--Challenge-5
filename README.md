# MaliyoUnity
##Contains Maliyo Studio project challenge 5.


Challenge 5:
I implemented a User Interface to the test with this whack-a-mole-like challenge in which i had to get all the food that pops up on a grid while avoiding the skulls.  I implemented this using debug buttons, mouse clicks, score tracking, restart sequences, and difficulty setting to get to the bottom of this one.
